      In 1999 British technology pioneer Kevin Ashton,
      <!-- Iteration 2: Use hyperlink for reaching to MIT homepage "https://autoid.mit.edu/" -->
      co-founder of the <a href="">Auto-ID Laboratory at MIT</a>,
      <!-- Iteration 3: Use hyperlink to reach IoT wikipedia & use Title attribute -->
      invented the term "<a href="" title="">The Internet of Things</a>" to
      describe a system where the Internet is connected to the physical world via ubiquitous sensors,
      <!-- Iteration 3: Use hyperlink to reach RFID wikipedia & use Title attribute -->
      including <a href="" title="">RFID (Radio-frequency identification)</a>.

    <!-- Iteration 5: Use hyperlinkas to e-mail anyone -->
    <a href="mailto:">Ashton</a>'s original definition was: 'Today computers—and, therefore, the Internet—are almost
    wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes (a
    petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were first captured and created
    by human beings—by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code.
    Conventional diagrams of the Internet ... leave out the most numerous and important routers of all - people.
    The problem is, people have limited time, attention and accuracy—all of which means they are not very
    good at capturing data about things in the real world. And that's a big deal. We're physical, and
    so is our environment ... You can't eat bits, burn them to stay warm or put them in your gas tank.
    Ideas and information are important, but things matter much more. Yet today's information technology is
    so dependent on data originated by people that our computers know more about ideas than things. If we
    had computers that knew everything there was to know about things—using data they
    gathered without any help from us—we would be able to track and count everything,
    and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing,
    repairing or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best.
    The Internet of Things has the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did.
    Maybe even more so.

    Ashton was born in <a href="" target="">Birmingham</a>, UK.
    He read Scandinavian Studies
    <!-- Iteration 6: Use of target attribute to open link on new tab -->
    at <a href="" target="">University College London</a>
    from 1990 to 1994. He was working as an assistant brand
    <!-- Iteration 7: Use hyperlink to reach Procter & Gamble wikipedia and use target attribute -->
    manager at <a href="" target="">Procter & Gamble</a>
    (P&G) in 1997 when he became interested in using RFID to help
    <!-- Iteration 8: Use hyperlink to reach supply chain wikipedia without Title attribute -->
    manage P&G's <a href="">supply chain</a>. This
    work led him to MIT, where he helped start an RFID research consortium called the Auto-ID Center with
    <!-- Iteration 9: Use hyperlink to reach supply chain wikipedia with Title attribute -->
    professors <a href="" title="">Sanjay Sarma</a>
    and Sunny Siu and researcher David Brock. The
    center opened in 1999 as an industry-sponsored research project with the goal of
    creating a global open standard system to put RFID everywhere. Ashton was the
    Center's Executive Director. Siu, then Sarma, acted as Research Director, later
    Chairman of Research. Under Ashton and Sarma's leadership, the number of sponsors
    grew to 103, and additional labs were funded at other major universities around the
    world. Once the system was developed, MIT licensed it to not-for-profit standards
    <!-- Iteration 10: Use hyperlink to reach GS1 wikipedia & use Title and target attribute -->
    body <a href="" title="" target="">GS1</a> and the project reached a
    successful conclusion. The labs were renamed
    <!-- Iteration 11: Use hyperlink to reach Auto-ID Labs wikipedia & use Title and target attribute -->
    <a href="" title="" target="">Auto-ID Labs</a> and
    continue their research.
